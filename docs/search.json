    "text": "During a first year analysis tutorial I tasked the students with the following exercise:\n\nLet \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) be a sequence. We are given that the subsequence of terms \\((a_{2k})_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) with even index and the subsequence \\((a_{2k-1})_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) of terms with odd index converge to the same limit \\(L\\). We wish to prove that full sequence \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) converges to \\(L\\).\n\nThis is an easy exercise. After fixing an arbitrary \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\) we find two ‘cut off’ indices: the first for which all even terms beyond the cut off are within distance \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(L\\); and the second for which all odd terms beyond the cut off are within distance \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(L\\). To finish we choose the full sequence cut off to be the maximum of the even and odd cut offs.\nIt’s important to note that the proof relies on the fact that the union of the index sequences \\((2k)\\) and \\((2k - 1)\\) contains all of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Moreover, we can easily extend the proof to obtain the following result:\n\nLet \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) be a sequence. Suppose we are given that finite collection of subsequences which all converge to the same limit \\(L\\), and whose union of index sequences contains all of \\(\\mathbb{N}_{&gt;k}\\) for some finite \\(k\\). We can conclude that \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) converges to \\(L\\).\n\nA student then asked if an analogous result holds for a countably infinite collection of subsequences. The method of proof used for the finite collection of subsequences breaks down for a countable collection as the maximum of a countable set (of cut offs in this case) is not necessarily finite. This should provoke us to look for a counterexample for which the cut off indices for each subsequence may exist arbitrarily far along the full sequence.\nWe obtain a counterexample by considering the sequence \\(a_n:=1\\) if \\(n\\) is prime, \\(a_n := 0\\) if \\(n\\) is composite. The countable collection of subsequences we choose is \\((a_{pk})_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) for each and every prime number \\(p\\). It is clear that the union of the corresponding index sequences is \\(\\mathbb{N}_{&gt;1}\\). Furthermore, every subsequence in the collection is exactly equal to \\((1,0,0,0,...)\\) and thus converges to \\(0\\). The full sequence is not convergent however since it is not Cauchy. In particular, \\(|a_{p+1} - a_p| = 1\\) for all primes \\(p\\) greater than \\(2\\).\n\nI felt that the first year student’s question had a sneaky enough answer to be worth frustrating some of the other applied maths PhD students with. Quite surprisingly, a majority could not quickly discern if the countably infinite case was true or false. Try out this prank on some of your friends who have long since studied first year analysis!"

    "text": "I encountered this exercise on the first sheet of a ‘Numerical Linear Algebra’ module.\nProblem Statement: Let \\(U\\) be an \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) upper triangular matrix which is zero along the diagonal, show \\(U^n=0\\). In other words, show that such a \\(U\\) is nilpotent.\nThoughts: The standard solution is to consider how the matrix \\(U\\) acts on each of the standard basis vectors: the image of \\(U^k\\) is the span of the remaining \\(n-k\\) vectors.\nAn alternative way to approach the problem (and the approach I thought of before the standard solution) is to view \\(U\\) as an adjacency matrix of a weighted digraph.\nLet’s restrict our view to a special matrix \\(S\\) which has one in all it’s entries above the diagonal. Consider a graph \\(G\\) of \\(n\\) nodes labelled \\(1\\) to \\(n\\), and let \\(S\\) be the adjacency matrix. This is a complete digraph that has each directed from the node with the smaller label to the node with the larger label.\nNow, the \\((i,j)\\)th entry of matrix \\(S^k\\) is the number of directed paths of length \\(k\\) from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\). The longest directed path in graph \\(G\\) is the the path \\(1,2,3,…,n\\) but this only has length \\(n-1\\), and we conclude that \\(S^n=0\\).\nThe proof adapts fairly easily to matrix \\(U\\), but is a bit messier. We start with a new notation: for directed path \\(P\\) we let \\(E_m(P)\\) denote the weight of the \\(m\\)th directed edge. The way we can adapt the proof is to observe that the \\((i,j)\\)th entry of matrix of \\(U^k\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sum_{P}\\prod_{m=1}^{k}E_m(P)\n\\]\nWhere we are summing over the directed paths \\(P\\) of length \\(k\\) from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\)."

    "text": "Let random variable \\(X\\) be distributed like a univariate Gaussian \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). It is very well known that the random variable \\(aX\\) is distributed like \\(N(a \\mu, a^{2} \\sigma^2)\\). Let us call this statement Lemma 1. Lemma 1 is so useful that it’s given (without proof) as early as the ‘hypothesis testing’ topic in A-level maths. Students who continue engaging with maths after A-level might find themselves making use Lemma 1, without ever having seen a proof. This certainly applied to me.\nMemorising a piece of mathematics without knowing (at least) a sketch of a proof can be dangerous, as I found out recently when requiring a very slight generalisation of Lemma 1. I needed to understand the following:\nQuestion: Let random vector \\(X\\) be distributed like an \\(n\\) dimensional multivariate Gaussian \\(N(\\mu, \\Sigma)\\). Let \\(A\\) be a real \\(m\\) by \\(n\\) matrix, how is the \\(m\\) dimensional random vector \\(AX\\) distributed?\nAnswering this question took me a little while, very embarrassing. Perhaps it would have been immediately obvious if I’d seen a proof of Lemma 1. Moreover, perhaps I would have saved some time and confusion if I’d known that Lemma 1 was only memorised, and I’d never proven it for myself. After some thought I arrived at Lemma 2:\nLemma 2: Let random vector \\(X\\) be distributed like an \\(n\\) dimensional multivariate Gaussian \\(N(\\mu, \\Sigma)\\). Let \\(A\\) be a real \\(m\\) by \\(n\\) matrix. The \\(m\\) dimensional random vector \\(AX\\) distributed like \\(N(A \\mu, A \\Sigma A^T)\\).\nProof (Sketch): We can see this with multivariate moment generating functions. Recall that for a multivariate Gaussian distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\Sigma )\\) the moment generating function is given by:\n\\[\nMGF(X) = \\mathbb{E}(exp({t^T X})) = exp(\\mu^Tt + \\frac{1}{2}t^T \\Sigma t)\n\\]\nNow, we can write \\(MGF(AX) = \\mathbb{E}(exp({t^T AX})) = \\mathbb{E}(exp({(A^Tt)^T X}))\\). This tells us that the moment generating function of \\(AX\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nMGF(AX) = exp(\\mu^TA^Tt + \\frac{1}{2}(A^Tt)^T \\Sigma A^Tt)\n= exp((A \\mu)^Tt + \\frac{1}{2} t^T A \\Sigma A^Tt).\n\\]\nWe conclude that \\(AX\\) is distributed like \\(N(A\\mu, A \\Sigma A^T)\\), as moment generating functions uniquely determine distributions.\nClosing Thoughts: Every modern mathematician uses results they don’t know how to prove, and it would be extremist to recommend only using a result if one can sketch a proof. I do think we should all try to be aware of when a result we’ve used is only memorised however, and in the case of simple results like Lemma 1, remedy that state of affairs before embarrassment might ensue.\nThe same sort of discussion doesn’t just apply to mathematical results, but also to other things, like opinions."
