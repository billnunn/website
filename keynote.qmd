**Talk Title:** Novel antimicrobial treatments and the importance of the host response.

**Abstract:** The global rise in antimicrobial resistance levels, coupled with the downturn in discovery of new antibiotics, has resulted in an urgent need for novel ways to tackle bacterial infections. Creative targets for such treatments include blocking resistance or virulence mechanisms employed by the bacteria. However, such approaches that do not directly kill the bacteria can rely heavily on an effective immune response. We demonstrate how mathematical modelling can be used to understand the consequences of this and to design effective treatment strategies.

**Talk Title:** Proximal Neural Networks for Computational Imaging

**Abstract:** A common approach to solve inverse imaging problems relies on finding a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the original unknown image, by solving a minimization problem. In this context, iterative proximal algorithms are widely used, enabling to handle non-smooth functions and linear operators. These methods have the advantage of benefiting from strong theoretical guarantees, ensuring their asymptotic convergence to a solution to the problem of interest which is key for decision-making processes. Recently, these proximal algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further improve the estimate quality. Two main approaches have been investigated in the literature: Plug-and-play algorithms where some of the operators appearing in proximal algorithms are replaced by neural networks, and unfolded neural networks that are obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear operators and parameters.

In this talk, we will explore these different methodological perspectives in computational imaging, and discuss their advantages and limitations.
