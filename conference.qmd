SAMBa ([**S**tatistical **A**pplied **M**athematics at **Ba**th](https://samba.ac.uk/)) is an EPSRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT). The SAMBa conference is held annually with the primary aim of showcasing research within the CDT remit.

A poster session and lighting talks from the newest PhD intake will also feature. Topics addressed will include statistics and ML; numerics and inverse problems; fluids and PDEs; applied probability and mathematical biology. Something to float the boat of any applied mathematician!

Lunch and afternoon drinks will be provided, with a conference dinner planned for the evening of the 10th.
