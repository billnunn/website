**Title:** Should I stay, or should I go: Sex ratio response drives a diverse range of (anti-)correlated intra-species behaviours

**Abstract:** The decision of an individual or group to leave its current environment may be influenced by various factors. These include external or inter-species factors such as the presence of predators or food availability, and also intra-species dynamics like mate searching or the strength of social ties within a group. Understanding the consequences of these behaviours on the population level dynamics is non-trivial. In this work, we explore a stochastic model describing the movement of males and females of a species between localised patches, in which the movement rates are dependent on the sex ratio within the patch. By deriving a system of stochastic differential equations governing the fluctuations in these patches we can model a diverse range of intra-species behaviours driven solely by an individual's response to local sex ratio. We subsequently uncover and explore how various individual behaviours can give rise to large scale (anti-)correlated movements between the sexes.

**Title:** Rough Mount Fuji accessibility percolation

**Abstract:** We consider a rooted tree where each vertex is labelled by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform(0,1) random variable, plus a parameter theta times its distance from the root. We study paths from the root to infinity along which the vertex labels are increasing. The existence of such increasing paths depends on both the structure of the tree and the value of theta. The goal is to determine the critical value of theta such that, above this value, increasing paths occur with positive probability, while below it, no such paths exist. Additionally, we extend this problem to consider the case of the integer lattice.
