**Title:** Exploring genetic ancestry with Coalescent Trees

**Abstract:** The genetic history of living beings is encoded in their DNA, and these sequences can be traced back to a common ancestor. A simple way to represent this ancestry is through *phylogenetic trees*— graphical models that depict the times at which pairs of sequences last shared a common ancestor. Since the true genealogical history is not directly observable, a probabilistic model known as the *Coalescent* is used to simulate this unseen history, while the observed genetic data guides the inference of likely ancestral trees. 

In this talk, I will introduce basic concepts from population genetics, and present an example from my research, where we simulate coalescent trees with a fixed length to explore the effects of constrained evolutionary timelines.

**Title:** Should I stay, or should I go: Sex ratio response drives a diverse range of (anti-)correlated intra-species behaviours

**Abstract:** The decision of an individual or group to leave its current environment may be influenced by various factors. These include external or inter-species factors such as the presence of predators or food availability, and also intra-species dynamics like mate searching or the strength of social ties within a group. Understanding the consequences of these behaviours on the population level dynamics is non-trivial. In this work, we explore a stochastic model describing the movement of males and females of a species between localised patches, in which the movement rates are dependent on the sex ratio within the patch. By deriving a system of stochastic differential equations governing the fluctuations in these patches we can model a diverse range of intra-species behaviours driven solely by an individual's response to local sex ratio. We subsequently uncover and explore how various individual behaviours can give rise to large scale (anti-)correlated movements between the sexes.

**Title:** Lobsters and the evolution of complexity

**Abstract:** Tagmosis is the process by which the number of and differentiation between body segments changes. This talk focusses on tagmosis in a highly simplified model of a lobster’s legs. The legs are assumed to perform three core functions: movement, food gathering and eating. By constructing a fitness function based on these necessary tasks, we investigate how a model lobster can maximise its fitness and how this fittest state varies as the level of differentiation between its legs changes. We use this model to consider the nature of constraints in shaping the fitness of organisms. Further, we discuss the evolution of complexity in light of these findings, highlighting two stages, both leading to an increase in complexity. The range of applicability of these findings is considered.

**Title:** Quantum algorithms for the exponential of Hamiltonian matrices​

**Abstract:** Computing the time evolution of quantum systems, by solving the Schrödinger equation and approximating matrix exponentials, is a fundamental task in quantum computing and numerical analysis. In this talk, we discuss some techniques for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum computers, including rational approximations, variational methods, and exponential splittings, with a focus on enabling long time steps that allow practical implementation on near-term quantum devices.

**Title:** Spatial regime conversion method

**Abstract:** We present a novel hybrid modelling approach for simulating one-dimensional, one-species reaction-diffusion systems that balances stochastic accuracy with computational efficiency. Our model automatically adapts to local particle concentrations, applying the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) in regions where stochastic effects are significant, and switching to partial differential equations (PDEs) where particle numbers are high. This dynamic regime conversion removes the need for a predefined interface, allowing the model to respond flexibly to evolving system states.

To ensure consistency across regimes, we employ a moment-closure method that bridges the stochastic reaction network with its deterministic PDE counterpart. We demonstrate the model’s accuracy and efficiency on benchmark problems, including simple diffusion and the Fisher-KPP equation.

This method offers a scalable framework for simulating reaction-diffusion systems, especially those where stochasticity plays a critical role in low-density regions but becomes computationally intensive at scale.

**Title:** Clustering of multivariate tail dependence using conditional methods

**Abstract:** Conditional extreme value models analyse joint tail behaviour by describing the distribution of a random vector’s components given one component exceeds a high threshold. Although flexible, estimates suffer high uncertainty due to the scarcity of extreme data. To our knowledge, clustering has not yet been explored for CE models.

We propose a clustering framework for CE models to summarise multivariate extremal dependence and identify sites with similar tail behaviour. Our approach defines a novel dissimilarity measure based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence and typical CE model assumptions, which is uniquely applicable in any dimension. We use k-medoids to cluster sites using this measure.

A simulation study demonstrates superior performance to existing bivariate methods across various extremal dependence structures and uniquely enables multivariate clustering. We also apply our framework to Irish meteorological data, revealing groups of sites with similar tail dependence between precipitation and wind speed.

**Title:** Rough Mount Fuji accessibility percolation

**Abstract:** We consider a rooted tree where each vertex is labelled by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform(0,1) random variable, plus a parameter theta times its distance from the root. We study paths from the root to infinity along which the vertex labels are increasing. The existence of such increasing paths depends on both the structure of the tree and the value of theta. The goal is to determine the critical value of theta such that, above this value, increasing paths occur with positive probability, while below it, no such paths exist. Additionally, we extend this problem to consider the case of the integer lattice.

**Title:** Greedy Learning to Optimise with convergence guarantees.

**Abstract:** Learning to Optimise (L2O) uses training data to speed up optimisation problems. Traditional unrolling methods, while effective, are often limited by memory constraints and lack convergence guarantees. We propose a novel greedy L2O approach that learns iteration-specific parameters by minimising the next iteration's function value.

This method allows for significantly longer training sequences with constant GPU memory. Our update parametrisation ensures that parameter learning is no more complex than solving the original optimisation problem, with convergence guarantees on test data. Empirical results on a Computed Tomography example show improved performance over classical algorithms like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method and L-BFGS.
