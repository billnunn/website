**Title:** Should I stay, or should I go: Sex ratio response drives a diverse range of (anti-)correlated intra-species behaviours

**Abstract:** The decision of an individual or group to leave its current environment may be influenced by various factors. These include external or inter-species factors such as the presence of predators or food availability, and also intra-species dynamics like mate searching or the strength of social ties within a group. Understanding the consequences of these behaviours on the population level dynamics is non-trivial. In this work, we explore a stochastic model describing the movement of males and females of a species between localised patches, in which the movement rates are dependent on the sex ratio within the patch. By deriving a system of stochastic differential equations governing the fluctuations in these patches we can model a diverse range of intra-species behaviours driven solely by an individual's response to local sex ratio. We subsequently uncover and explore how various individual behaviours can give rise to large scale (anti-)correlated movements between the sexes.

**Title:** Spatial regime conversion method

**Abstract:** We present a novel hybrid modelling approach for simulating one-dimensional, one-species reaction-diffusion systems that balances stochastic accuracy with computational efficiency. Our model automatically adapts to local particle concentrations, applying the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) in regions where stochastic effects are significant, and switching to partial differential equations (PDEs) where particle numbers are high. This dynamic regime conversion removes the need for a predefined interface, allowing the model to respond flexibly to evolving system states.

To ensure consistency across regimes, we employ a moment-closure method that bridges the stochastic reaction network with its deterministic PDE counterpart. We demonstrate the model’s accuracy and efficiency on benchmark problems, including simple diffusion and the Fisher-KPP equation.

This method offers a scalable framework for simulating reaction-diffusion systems, especially those where stochasticity plays a critical role in low-density regions but becomes computationally intensive at scale.

**Title:** Rough Mount Fuji accessibility percolation

**Abstract:** We consider a rooted tree where each vertex is labelled by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform(0,1) random variable, plus a parameter theta times its distance from the root. We study paths from the root to infinity along which the vertex labels are increasing. The existence of such increasing paths depends on both the structure of the tree and the value of theta. The goal is to determine the critical value of theta such that, above this value, increasing paths occur with positive probability, while below it, no such paths exist. Additionally, we extend this problem to consider the case of the integer lattice.
